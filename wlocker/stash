1. locker (wlocker)
 - responsible for encrypt/decrypt/concurrency/write to disk
 - can encrypt or decrypt
 - can lock or unlock
 - gets from/writes to disk encrypted bytestream
2. account controller (wacctmgr)
 - holds account metadata and references to accounts
 - accounts no longer are uint32's, they're strings
 - accounts now have a description field
 - accounts also have a type which defines which implementation of the account interface is used
 - account is no longer associated with a BIP44 account
 - serializes/unserializes account metadata to a byte stream
 - can tell you which account addresses have which utxos
 - stores the utxos in the db in a standard way with an account
 - interacts with account plugin, locker, sync package and address controller
3. account "plugin"/interface (wacctmgr/bip0044, etc)
 - serialize/unserializes addresses to a byte stream
 - serialize/unserialize any priv/pub seed data to a byte stream
 - provides addresses which get looked up in address controller
 - registers to controller various callbacks
 - lets the controller know what capabilities it has
 - clears sensitive data
 - provides a state for serialization (how many external addrs, etc)
 - interacts with serialization package
4. address controller (waddrmgr)
 - adds descriptions for addresses
 - adds descriptions to tx's where this address sends or receives
 - allows import/export of the address/tx descriptions
 - interacts with serialization package
5. standard serialization package (btcutil/serialize?)
 - can serialize/unserialize uint32, uint64, etc to a bytestream
